Options to adjust sun & sky & exposure settings, includes:

- Sun disk size
- Sun bloom
- Enable/Disbale lens flare when facing sun
- Sky exposure
- Daytime Ambient lighting control
- Dark area exposure brighten

### Sun disk size

Sliding the bar to adjust the size of the sun disk

### Sun Bloom

Adjust the sun bloom strength. It actually overrides the Blooms settings in PhotoMode, which means other artifical light bloom will also be affected.

### Lens Flare

Option to toggle sun light lens flare effect when facing the sun

### Sky Exposure

This option can adjust the sky exposure. Higher value will also brighten everything and reduce the impact ratio from sun light in the final view of the scene.

### Ambient Lighting

Behave likes those mods with shadow strength adjustment / ambient lighting in CS1, but only affects daytime lighting. 
High value will make shadow lookes more blue (Because most of ambient lighting comes from sky)

### Dark Area Exposure

This options controls the auto exposure behaivour in game. High Level will keeps dark area bright enough, but cause birghter area over-exposed (such as sky or sun)

### NOTES

Sun Bloom Settings in mod will overwrite the effects in PhotoMode, 
but Sky Exposure & Dark Area Exposure will affect nothings. They work independently
